# TDA2003 10W Amplifier

First try at making a TDA2003 10W amplifier at 12V.

Revisions:
0.1 - The first layout.

Targets:
- Improve circuit layout and reduce PCB size.
- Improve sound quality/frequency response.
- Improve isolation and filtering.
- Add a line / guitar input.
- Add gain control.
- Add EQ. (Don't know if analog or digital EQ)
- Add SFX. (Delay, distortion, etc.)
- Increase Wattage.

Those are my targets to reach in the coming months I hope I can reach them all.
